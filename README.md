# Kaggle Notebooks

This repository includes machine learning and data analysis projects on datasets from Kaggle.

Most important are:
* California Housing - Great dataset for regression. There are a lot of variables so feature selection is important.
* Future Sales - Dataset for time series analysis.
* Titanic dataset - most popular datasets for beginners. It was my first notebook on Kaggle. 
* League of Legends - just for fun.
* Newspapers - basic dataset for text classification.
